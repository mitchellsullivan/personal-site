I was spurred to create this blog yesterday, in order to post about this before it was fixed; I did so just in time. It was changed in the update today, less than two weeks after I reported it with the solution. I never received a response from the team, so I can't really prove that I had anything to do with it.

Fortunately, last night I took a series of screenshots to illustrate. Screenshot taken at 20:34 on Oct. 5 (top) versus 17:03 on Oct. 6 (bottom).
